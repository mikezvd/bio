- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikezvd , I've studied Computer Science at uni but had to drop-off in my last year (2014) for monetary reasons, and since then been working in very different places and have experience in admin, sales, hospitality, retail, and now in health as a Medical Lab Assistant in Pathology, and in every job after achieving a management postion it never challenged me more, making me look for something different. 

- I've applied to some jobs in IT around 2017, but at the time it was harder to get a job without a degree, so I stopped applying.
- Nowadays it became way easier, so I restarted the studies on my own and I'm currently building my portfolio to showcase my skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning the Full-stack Development skillset. With a strong interest to learn Cyber Security and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5 with CSS and Javascript, building my website with info and my projects displayed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will improve my knowledge and help me land my first job in IT.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
